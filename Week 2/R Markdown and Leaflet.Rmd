## Background
Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

## Assignment:
```{r}
library(leaflet)
```
```{r}
new_icon <- awesomeIcons(
  icon = 'ios-close',
  iconColor = 'black',
  library = 'ion',
  markerColor = "red"
)

content <- paste(sep = "<br/>",
  "<b>Cafe Gl√ºck</b>",
  "Nallagandla, Serilingampally",
  "Hyderabad, Telangana 500019"
)

my_map <- leaflet() %>%
    addTiles() %>%
    addAwesomeMarkers(lat = 17.4645704, lng = 78.2891014,
        icon = new_icon,

    addPopups(lat = 17.4645704, lng = 78.2891014, content,
